# WDWNT Tip Board

This is a simple Node.js app that calls a bunch of APIs and makes a beautiful "Today at Disney" page per destination.

Destinations include:
* Walt Disney World (`/wdw`)
* Disneyland (`/dlr`)
* Tokyo Disneyland (`/tdr`)
* Disneyland Paris (`/dlp`)
* Hong Kong Disneyland (`/hkdl`)
* Shanghai Disneyland (`/shdr`)

Enjoy!
